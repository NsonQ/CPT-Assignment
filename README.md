## Description
This repository contains an implementation of the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm in Python, developed as part of the CPT212 Assignment 2. The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a highly efficient string searching algorithm that utilises preprocessing techniques to skip sections of the text, making it faster than naive string matching methods.
